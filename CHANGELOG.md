# Changelog
## v2.0
- Framerate issues have been addressed. That includes issues in the original game, especially noticeable in 3-2 (hard mode).
- Mario's sprites have been revamped. They are mostly the same size as the originals.
- Mario's relative position when jumping has been fixed. This was responsible for the weird collision issues in v1.0 (yeah, it wasn't the sprites).
- Luigi has been added. He has slightly different physics.
- Old graphics are now an option. Not all graphics are unchanged, as it mostly affects the sprites, but this should be good enough for people who didn't like the new ones.
- A shortcut to difficult mode has been added.
- New palette for Superball Mario/Luigi.
- New animation for Super Mario/Luigi when looking up.
- New animation for Super Mario/Luigi when entering a pipe.
- Options menu added to accomodate the new options.
- Battery added to permanently save your options, top score and level selection.
- Every single stage's colors have been tweaked.
- An incompatibility screen for the original Game Boy has been added.
- Hundreds of minor (and not so minor) changes and fixes.
