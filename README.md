# Super Mario Land DX

## What is this?
Super Mario Land DX is a romhack of the original Super Mario Land for the GameBoy that turns the game into a GameBoy Color game.
It adds color and changes the graphics to give the game a modern look.

## How do I apply this patch?
You have to use an IPS patching program (e.g. Lunar IPS) on a Super Mario Land ROM. Please make sure to use the appropriate patch for your revision.

## Does this work on real hardware?
Yes!

## Building
### Dependencies
- WLA-DX >=v10.0

### Steps to follow
1. Install Martin Allen's Land Forger (http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1195/). It works on Wine.
2. Use Land Forger to apply /data/leveldata.lfd on a fresh Super Mario Land ROM (both v1.0 & v1.1 are supported)
3. Name the modified ROM "sml.gb" and place it in the same folder as main.asm
4. Run compile.sh (Linux/WSL) or compile.ps1 (Windows)
